          <h1>FAQS</h1>
          <p>
            The following are a collection of questions and answers which we, as
            an organization, find ourselves recieving the most by people
            intrigued about our Animal Research and Rescue Center.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>What happens to the animals which you rescue?</dt>
            <dd>
              The animals which we rescue are taken good care of in our facility
              by our highly trained staff. They are fed and slowly adjusted to
              their natural enviroment which we prepare them for so they are not
              lost or struggle to survive on their own. In certain special cases
              if the animal is in the endangered species list we tend to keep
              them at our facility to reproduce more and later ensure that the
              population is at a healthy standpoint before we release them out
              in the wild.

            <dt>How can I become a volunteer at this center?</dt>
            <dd>
              Becoming a volunteer or member at our Animal Research and Rescue
              Center can simply be done by contacting us via email or by simply
              calling our facility. All of our contact information can be found
              on the <a href="Contact.html">contact</a> tab of this website. You
              can also make an appointment with us to visit our facility in
              which we will provide you with a tour guide to learn more in depth
              about our animals and facilitation.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              Is there any fee that is required to become a volunteer or to
              visit this center?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              There is no required fee to become a volunteer at our center as we
              see your desire to help take care of our animals as a payment in
              itself. To visit our center there is also no required fee, however
              there is a donation option which visitors are open to providing
              for since all this money will simply be going to help the animals
              and our research on them.
            </dd>
            <dt>What are some of my responsibilities as a Volunteer?</dt>
            <dd>
              As a volunteer you will simply aid the staff with some of the less
              strenuous and difficult tasks which only our well trained faculty
              will be dealing with. Volunteers will help with more basic errand
              related tasks. As volunteers you will not be allowed to take full
              care of animals by yourself as we do not want untrained hands
              dealing with them, but your help will be crucial nonetheless.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              What is the difference between becoming a volunteer and a member?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A volunteer as stated in the question above will be running small
              errands, but still extremely crucial. We do not driscrimante
              against age, however a parent or guardian must accompany any minor
              who wishes to volunteer at our facility. Becoming a member
              requires such person(s) to be at least 18 years of age and is
              already trained with animal research and rescue or is willing to
              be trained by our faculty to perform more labor intensive tasks.
