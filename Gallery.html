            <img src="Images/Red Wolf.jpeg" alt="Red Wolf Pup" />
            <p>
              This is Swiper who is a baby Red Wolf pup which we rescued out in
              the wild and is currently kept in our center as his kind is
              limited out in the wild.

            />
            <p>
              This is an image of Screech, the Long-Eared Owl on the left and
              Houdini, the Short-Eared on the right. Neither of these animals
              were hurt when we found them, however at our facility we did not
              have much research on either of the two species of owls so we took
              them in. Houdini will most likely stay with us as his kind are
              endangered.

            />
            <p>
              This is a baby Black-Footed Ferret who was born in our facility.
              This is another of the species whose population is low in the wild
              meaning we will be taking care of her at our facility. She does
              not have a name yet so you are more than welcome to send us name
              ideas through our email on the
              <a href="Contact.html">contact</a> page.

          <div id="Eagle">
            <img src="Images/Golden Eagle.jpeg" alt="Golden Eagle" />
            <p>
              This is Dash who is a young Golden Eagle which we found struggling
              to fly as one of his wings seemed to have been injured as he was
              visibly strugling to open his right wing.
            </p>

          <div id="Snake">
            <img src="Images/Queen Snake.jpeg" alt="Queen Snake" />
            <p>
              This is Medusa the Queen Snake who as we were on the look out for
              more reptiles to do research on, we saw her slithering her way
              into our camp site. She made all her way near the container in
              which we kept our bait in case of luring any sort of species
              around if we struggled to do so naturally.
            </p>

          <div id="Terrapin">
            <img
              src="Images/Diamondback Terrapin.jpeg"
              alt="Diamondback Terrapin"
            />
            <p>
              This tiny little creature thats waving at you is Piplup who is a
              Diamondback Terrapin. The small stature of these species is why
              they are on the endangered species list as the shell size for a
              male grows only up to 5.5 inches while females reach to 11 inches.
              Piplup here can easily be picked up using only your index finger
              and thumb.
